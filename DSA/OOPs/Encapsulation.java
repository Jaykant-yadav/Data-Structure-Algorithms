/*
 * Encapsulation means binding data (variables) and methods (functions) that

 * 
 * Simply put: itâ€™s data hiding + data control inside a class.

/*
 * Why Encapsulation?
 * 
 * âœ… To protect the data from unauthorized access
 * âœ… To control how data is modified
 * âœ… To make the class easy to maintain and flexible
 * âœ… To achieve data abstraction
 * 
 * ðŸ”¹ How Encapsulation Works in Java
 * Declare variables as private (cannot be accessed directly).
 * Provide public getter and setter methods to access and modify them safely.

/*
 * Short Definition for Interview:
 * 
 * Encapsulation in Java is the process of wrapping data and methods into a
 * single unit (class) and restricting direct access to data by making variables
 * private and providing public getter and setter methods.
